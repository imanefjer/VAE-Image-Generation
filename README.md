# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for Image Generation

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`VAE-Image-Generation.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The notebook highlights:
- Training a VAE on image data (e.g., MNIST).
- Generating new images by sampling from the VAE's latent space.
- Exploring specific points in the latent space to observe the VAE's learned representations.

## Features
- Random image generation from a normal distribution in the latent space.
- Visualizing the effects of decoding specific latent points.
- Insights into the structure of the learned latent space.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
